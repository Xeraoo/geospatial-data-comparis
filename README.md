# Overview

This MATLAB script performs a statistical comparison of two geospatial datasets, Geoportal1 and Up42, focusing on the following key operations:

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data and rounding values.
- Statistical Analysis: Calculation of key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Standard Deviation (SD), Mean Error (ME), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
- DTM Uncertainty Analysis: Evaluating the accuracy of the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) using RMSE and SD to assess its reliability.
- Data Visualization: Generating scatter plots and histograms to visualize relationships between the datasets.

# Features

- Preprocessing: Fills missing data with mean values and rounds dataset values to simplify analysis.
- Statistical Metrics: Computes common metrics (MAE, SD, ME, RMSE) for geospatial data comparison.
- DTM Accuracy Evaluation: Analyzes DTM data to assess its accuracy based on RMSE and SD thresholds.
- Visualizations: Includes scatter plots and histograms to offer a clear view of data distributions and correlations.
